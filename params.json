Palladio, influenced by Roman and Greek architecture, primarily by Vitruvius, is widely considered the most influential individual in the history of Western architecture. All of his buildings are located in what was the Venetian Republic, but his teachings, summarized in the architectural treatise, The Four Books of Architecture, gained him wide recognition.The city of Vicenza and the Palladian Villas of the Veneto are UNESCO World Heritage Sites.\r\n\r\n###  Villa Capra \"La Rotonda\"\r\n\r\nVilla La Rotonda is a Renaissance villa just outside Vicenza, northern Italy, designed by Andrea Palladio. The proper name is Villa Almerico Capra, but it is also known as La Rotonda, Villa Rotonda, Villa Capra and Villa Almerico. The name \"Capra\" derives from the Capra brothers, who completed the building after it was ceded to them in 1591. Like other works by Palladio in Vicenza and the surrounding area, the building is conserved as part of the World Heritage Site \"City of Vicenza and the Palladian Villas of the Veneto\".\r\nIn 1565 a priest, Paolo Almerico, on his retirement from the Vatican (as referendario apostolico of Pope Pius IV and afterwards Pius V), decided to return to his home town of Vicenza in the Venetian countryside and build a country house. This house, later known as 'La Rotonda', was to be one of Palladio's best-known legacies to the architectural world. Villa Capra may have inspired a thousand subsequent buildings, but the villa was itself inspired by the Pantheon in Rome.\r\n\r\n![prima](https://github.com/RdL87/RdL.finalProject/blob/master/Villa_Rotonda_side.jpg?raw=true)\r\n\r\n## Construction of the model\r\n\r\n### ...by PLASM\r\n\r\nUsing the functions of libraries plasm (functional language for computing with geometry) implemented with javascript you can create 3D models of all kinds. \r\nYou only need a little patience, a lot of study and a little practice (actually a lot of practice!).\r\n\r\n![int](https://github.com/RdL87/RdL.finalProject/blob/master/intera.png?raw=true)\r\n\r\n### Study of the villa\r\n\r\nLooking at the villa is easy to notice the symmetry between the various elements that compose it.You can identify the basic elements that make up the villa and to represent them. Then you can focus on details that decorate it.\r\n\r\n### Decomposition of the villa\r\n\r\nThe three essential elements that make up the villa are a central body, an entry, and a dome in the center of it. Now we will see how these three elements have been made ​​even looking at pictures and a bit of code.\r\n\r\n###  Central body\r\n![cent](https://github.com/RdL87/RdL.finalProject/blob/master/CorpoCentrale.png?raw=true)\r\n\r\nTo make the central body is needed to build a single-sided. \r\nWe can see the code for the skeleton of the facade only with door and windows with no details.\r\n\r\n> var front1 = SIMPLEX_GRID([\r\n> \t[20],\r\n> \t[2],\r\n> \t[1.5]\r\n> \t]);\r\n\r\n> var front2 = SIMPLEX_GRID([\r\n> \t[2.5,-1,13,-1,2.5],\r\n> \t[-2,1],\r\n> \t[1.5]\r\n> \t]);\r\n\r\n> var front3 = SIMPLEX_GRID([\r\n> \t[20],\r\n> \t[-3,1],\r\n> \t[1.5]\r\n> \t]);\r\n\r\n> var front4 = SIMPLEX_GRID([\r\n> \t[9,-2,9],\r\n> \t[-4,1],\r\n> \t[1.5]\r\n> \t]);\r\n\r\n\r\n> var front5 = SIMPLEX_GRID([\r\n> \t[2.5,-1,2.5,-1,2,-2,2,-1,2.5,-1,2.5],\r\n> \t[-5,3],\r\n> \t[1.5]\r\n> \t]);\r\n\r\n> var front6 = SIMPLEX_GRID([\r\n> \t[9,-2,9],\r\n> \t[-8,1],\r\n> \t[1.5]\r\n> \t]);\r\n\r\n> var front7 = SIMPLEX_GRID([\r\n> \t[20],\r\n> \t[-9,7],\r\n> \t[1.5]\r\n> \t]);\r\n\r\n> var front8 = SIMPLEX_GRID([\r\n> \t[2.5,-1,2.5,-1,6,-1,2.5,-1,2.5],\r\n> \t[-16,1],\r\n> \t[1.5]\r\n> \t]);\r\n\r\n> var front9 = SIMPLEX_GRID([\r\n> \t[20],\r\n> \t[-17,1],\r\n> \t[1.5]\r\n> \t]);\r\n\r\n> allfront = COLOR([0.992,0.96,0.901])(STRUCT([front1,front2,front3,front4,front5,front6,front7,front8,front9]));\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIndeed, given the symmetry of the villa, the other three sides can be obtained by rotations and translations of the first how we can see in the code below.\r\n\r\n> //riunisco tutto nella struttura front\r\n\r\n> var front = STRUCT([allfront, border,borderlines,windowDecorations,doorDecorations,\r\n> glasses,grid,middlewindowframe,upperwindowframe,tetto]);\r\n\r\n> //mediante delle rototraslazioni dalla prima facciata ottengo il cubo centrale della villa\r\n\r\n> var ffront = T([0,2])([20,20])(R([0,2])([PI])(front));\r\n\r\n> var lfront = T([2])([20])(R([0,2])([PI/2])(front));\r\n\r\n> var rfront = T([0])([20])(R([0,2])([3/2*PI])(front));\r\n\r\n### Dome\r\nThe dome is located exactly in the center of the house and is composed of a cylinder, a roof (precisely dome) and a particular place on its tip.\r\n\r\n![dome](https://github.com/RdL87/RdL.finalProject/blob/master/Cupola.png?raw=true)\r\n\r\nThe roof of the dome and the detail at the tip have been obtained so:\r\n\r\n> //disegno il tetto della cupola\r\n\r\n> var domain = DOMAIN([[0,1],[0,2*PI]])([10,10]);\r\n\r\n> var profile = BEZIER(S0)([[7,25,25],[6,26,26],[5,26.5,26.5],[4,26.8,26.8],[3,27.1,27.1],[2,27.3,27.3],[1,27.5,27.5]]);\r\n> var mapping = ROTATIONAL_SURFACE(profile);\r\n\r\n> var surface = COLOR([0.804,0.31,0.223,1])(MAP(mapping)(domain));\r\n\r\n> tettoCupola = T([0,2])([10,10])(R([1,2])([-PI/2])(surface));\r\n\r\n> // disegno il dettaglio sulla punta della cupola\r\n\r\n> var domain = DOMAIN([[0,1],[0,2*PI]])([10,10]);\r\n\r\n> var profile = BEZIER(S0)([[1,27.5,27.5],[1,28,28],[0.5,28.4,28.4],[0.2,29,29],[0.1,29.5,29.5],[0,29.6,29.6]]);\r\n\r\n> var mapping = ROTATIONAL_SURFACE(profile);\r\n\r\n> var surface = MAP(mapping)(domain);\r\n\r\n> puntaCupola = COLOR([0.992,0.96,0.901])(T([0,2])([10,10])(R([1,2])([-PI/2])(surface)));\r\n\r\n### Entry\r\n\r\n![ingr](https://github.com/RdL87/RdL.finalProject/blob/master/Ingresso.jpeg?raw=true)\r\n\r\nThe entry is made in turn by a flight of steps, a basement with a subway, a pediment, roof and six Ionic columns.\r\nWe can observe from the side..\r\n\r\n![lato](https://github.com/RdL87/RdL.finalProject/blob/master/ingressoVistalato.png?raw=true)\r\n\r\n..and from the front\r\n\r\n![difronte](https://github.com/RdL87/RdL.finalProject/blob/master/IngressoVistaFronte.png?raw=true)\r\n\r\nProbably,the most interesting code to see is that of the ionic column. \r\n\r\n>

(STRUCT([baseqColonna1,baseqColonna2, baserColonna1,baserColonna2, corpoColonna,decorazioneColonna1,decorazioneColonna2])); \r\n\r\n## Conclusions\r\n\r\nThe realization of this project was the culmination of a process that began early in the course of computer graphics.It was not easy, but remembering my first design, now i'm very satisfied. There is still much to improve but looking at the images below unless some details the villas are very similar.\r\n\r\n![lato](https://github.com/RdL87/RdL.finalProject/blob/master/villaDilato.jpg?raw=true)\r\n\r\n![lato2](https://github.com/RdL87/RdL.finalProject/blob/master/lato.jpg?raw=true)\r\n\r\nThanks to the professor and to his worthy assistants.\r\n\r\nRoberto di Lallo, CVD Lab, 454591\r\n\r\nFor the complete code of the model click [here](https://github.com/cvdlab-cg/454591/blob/master/final-project/laRotonda.js)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"}
